Tools for creating an unbalanced node tree

This was written for a coding test in which I was asked to write a program that created an unbalanced tree of nodes based on word frequency.

The program was to be written in Java and to use as little outside code as possible. Since I had never written in Java before, I found the assignment wonderfully challenging.
